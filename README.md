firebase simple email and pass auth has been used for registrations.
Firebase configs where implemented into the app bby firebase cli.
I've only used state management, dependency injection and firebase packages.
The app is responsive.

## Project brief document about challenges

The hardest challenge in this project was to define clean code and folder architecture.

I overcame this challenge by searching a lot about clean architecture and repeating every use case
this app has over and over again in my head. I edited the structure a lot and found sth useful for
the app eventually.

Other parts of the app did not have any hard challenges and all of the problems got fixed quickly.

Managing the state in clean architecture is also challenging.

I've implemented abstractions, use cases, entities etc to fully separate UI and logic.

This architecture helps us edit every section of the ap easily without the need of changing all the
structure.
